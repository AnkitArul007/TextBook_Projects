        <h1 style="color:crimson; outline: darkmagenta; background-color: darkseagreen; text-align: center;"><b>FY Budget 2022-2023</b></h1>
        <!--subheading-->
        <h3 style="color:darkblue;">Budget 2022 focuses on growth boosting high multiplayer capital, infra spending</h3>
        <p> The government has allocated Rs, 2.1 trillion for food subsidy and Rs. 730 billion for the <B>MNREGA</B> programme. While both these amounts<br>
             are expectedly lower than the FY2022 levels, it will likely raise the allocation on these accounts if warranted during then course of then year.</p>
        <p> The government of India has only pencilled in a modest total spending growth of 4.6 percent for FY2023, over a 7.4% growth in FY2022.<br>
         However, it has budgeted for a much higher capex expansion of 24.5% in FY2023, with enlarged allocations of roads and railways, in <br>
         addition to a sharp increase in assistance to states for capital expenditure.</p>    
         <p>The most important part of the budget of FY2022 is the huge spending on <b>Defence system</b> of our country.The government <br>
        has also equally kept their attention towards the agricultural field as it is the back bone of a nation like India.  </p>
        <h5 style="color:darkkhaki">My Views On the <b>Budget</b> of 2022</h5>
        <p>According to me, the FY2022 budget is a very balanced budget as it has been made keeping in mind the core interest of all the sectors.<br>
            Especially the <b> military and defency system </b> of a country like India which shares its borders with coutries like Pakistan and China.
